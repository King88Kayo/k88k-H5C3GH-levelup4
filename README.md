# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

# Brief Look Back

# User Story


AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


# Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

# My Overview

The purpose of this project is to consolidate the HTML and CSS code and create a more accessible worfklow. This will also allow the next developer to easily understand the structure of the HTML and CSS code.

This project allowed me to practise using semantic HTML and CSS code allowing for a more logical structure. 

I have also learned how to use Github and store my work online in a secure environment and accessible to the development communnity which connects me to other developers.
